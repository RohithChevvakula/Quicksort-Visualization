# QuickSort Algorithm
Quicksort is one of the divide and conquer algorithm used to quickly sort an array for instance using partitioning method. Quicksort algorithm selects an element as pivot and perform sorting by partitioning around the selected pivot according to whether they are less than or greater than pivot. 
Choosing a pivot is crucial. Choice of pivot can either be dependent on partition routine or can be completely random.

### pseudo code for QuickSort function:
```JavaScript
/* low  –> Starting index,  high  –> Ending index */
quickSort(arr[], low, high) {
   if (low < high) {
        /* pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at right place */
        pi = partition(arr, low, high);
        quickSort(arr, low, pi – 1);  // Before pi
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high); // After pi
    }
}
```

Quicksort is performed by first partitioning the given array and then placing elements smaller than pivot before it and elements greater than pivot are placed after it. This action is recursive in nature. The sub-arrays are sorted again and again until we get a sorted array.
